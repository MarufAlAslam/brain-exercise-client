# Welcome Abroad! You are seeing the awesome project "Brain-Exercise"

Visit Live Link from : http://brain-exercise-60233.web.app/

## A Small Details about this

This project is been developed to test my knowledge in React Basically.Several Node packages been used here Like, 
<ul>
<li>react-router-dom</li>
<li>tailwind css</li>
<li>daisyUI</li>
<li>react-hook-form</li>
<li>react-to-pdf</li>
<li>react-icons</li>
<li>firebase</li>
</ul>
and so on.
<br/>

## Working Process

1. Create a brand new react app using <span style='color: yellow'>create-react-app<span>

2. Connect with git

3. Create a new branch and push it to github

3. Install all the necessary packages one by one

4. Create a new firebase project and connect it with the app

5. Create a new folder for the firebase and create a firebase config file for the app

6. Create Components/Pages where necessary

7. Create Routes for the pages using <span style='color: yellow'>react router dom<span>

8. Create a new folder for the context and create a context for the app

9. Create a Broken page form 404 routes

10. Create a Private route component and use it for the private routes.

11. Create Sign in and sign up methods using <span style='color: yellow'>firebase auth<span>

12. Build app using <span style='color: yellow'>npm build<span>

13. Connect the website with firebase hosting

14. Deploy the app using <span style='color: yellow'>firebase deploy<span>

15. Go to the live link(http://brain-exercise-60233.web.app/) and enjoy the app













### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
