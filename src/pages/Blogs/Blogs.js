                    <p>
                        Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.

                    <p>
                        I am using firebase because it is easy to implement and it is free. I can use other options like Auth0, AWS Cognito, Okta, etc.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Private route is a route that is only accessible to authenticated users. It is implemented by checking if the user is authenticated or not. If the user is authenticated, then the user is allowed to access the route. If the user is not authenticated, then the user is redirected to the login page.

                    <p>
                        Node.js, or Node is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
